# Linear Regression Project  
*A simple end-to-end implementation of linear regression and compairing with the premade linear regression model(sklearn). (for educational/analytical purposes)*

## 🧾 Project Overview  
This repository demonstrates how to build and interpret a linear regression model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to show how to take a dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a model, evaluate it, and derive actionable insights.

## 🔍 Features  
- Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlations, distributions, outlier detection)  
- Model building using the linear regression algorithm  
- Model evaluation (R², MAE, MSE, RMSE)  
- Visualization of results and regression line insights  
- Code structured for clarity (in `src/Linear_Regression.ipynb`)  

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
(See requirements in `requirements.txt`)
